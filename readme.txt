This repo contains various bits of code for dealing with Intelligent Qube and the three related games. All the code is written in C# 2.0.

The IQTasRNG directory contains a command line tool to output the best puzzle sets over an RNG range and was used to pick the highest scoring ones for a TAS.

The KurushiRNG directory contains code to output stats and sequences for all of the IQ games. This includes decompression code for the puzzle data files in the IQ Final and beyond games.

The PuzzlePreview directory contains an interactive gui 'plan-a-gram' to help solve puzzles that the IQTasRNG program spat out without needing the game. It currently only loads and knows the turn counts for the first game, but there's no reason it couldn't support the others.

This directory contains the code for an IQ tracker for the original game I used as additional info when streaming high score attempts on the game.

IQTracker
------------

Please note, this tool only works for Intelligent Qube/Kurushi. The formulas in the game are different for IQ Final/Kurushi Final, IQ Remix+, and IQ Mania and so will not be correctly generated by this tool.

Usage
-------------

Click the "IQ Tracker" text to change the level you're playing on/simulating. Level 0 is the default just like the game, and level 4 is the highest (the level does change the IQ calculation, so it does matter)

Enter the total cumulative score (including the stage bonus) in the score side of the app. So if you finish Stage 1 with 100,000 points and get 27,000 stage bonus, enter 127,000 in the -1- box. Then you finish stage 2 with 265,000 and get 40,000 stage bonus, enter 305,000 in the -2- box, etc.

After entering the score, click Update at the bottom and the running IQ will be calculated.

Clicking Reset will clear all the scores.

CaneofPacci on twitch/twitter has (or had at one point) a google doc/spreadsheet version of this tool. He's a jam up guy so if you need something more color-customisable for a stream or whatever, he'll probably help you out.
