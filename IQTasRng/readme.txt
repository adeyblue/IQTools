This directory contains a command line tool to calculate and output the 10 best puzzle sets for a given selection of waves. It was mainly created to find the best puzzle sets for my various TASes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_7VUEGHTk4 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPHom5ULe3Y) given a range of possible RNG seeds.

To use
---------

As this was written for a one-shot TAS (that I ended up doing twice, and then a speed one), everything is hardcoded into the app. To change what it generates:

Go to the Main function in Program.cs
Change the puzzleDiagramsOutputDir variable to a directory on your computer where the tool should output images of the best stage patterns (see the NewScoreTas/OldScoreTas/SpeedTas for examples of what it outputs).
change the startPoint and endPoint variables further down to the desired RNG range
Change the last argument of Find10BestInRNGRange to the desired stage

Then compile and run. Depending on whether the CAPTURES, TURNS or POINTS defines are set, it'll either output the best 10 seeds that generate the most capturable cubes, the most points (as determined by the CalcPuzzlePoints function) or require the fewest turns as defined by their TRNs (the number that appears on the bottom of the move count while you're playing)

The OrigScoreTas and NewScoreTas directories contain the images of the stage patterns used the respective tases as generated by the program.
