This is just random notes I was making while making the tas. It's probably not useful. All addresses are specific to the Japanese version


If already have 40 rows on stage, next perfect will push existing floor marks forward one row!!

0x24d frame count after intro

First possible puzzle pattern seed after intro, changing controls and game speed is 0x3ee

First possible without intro with changing controls and game speed is 0x3ee - 0x2ad + 1 = 0x1a2

Hold circle on frame

Start of stage 4, horizontally aligned, +- 20 misaligned verically




Bizhawk - set breakpoint on write to 76bd0 - stops same frame as stage srand


Start of game:
Press circle on game frame 2543 (0x9ef)
Intro ends at 0x24d game frames

Mem addresses
0x76be0 = Frame count
0xa0334 = Camera Focus X
0xa0354 = Character X loc (when x = 0, go through middle)


Each frame of horizontal/vertical pressed movement = a change of +/-40 units
Each frame of diagonal movement = 28 X/Y units to the right/up, 29 to the left/down

To align y-coord (run straight right toggling up & down each frame, each two presses adjusts vertical +1, horizontal re-aligns every 10 frames of doing this

When on the divisible boundaries, preference is right and down

Highest Character X = 1199
Lowest Character X = -1199

To move through cubes unsquashed - need to be exactly at -600, 0, or +600 X coordinate

If character x doesn't = camera focus location, next controller ove, character x resets to camera focus X

15000-15600-16200-16800-17400-18000

-1500 to 1500 - horz lines at -900,-300,300,900

After triangle, and the cubes have stopped have 
0x3fbe - 0x3fb1 = 14 frames
0x42a0 - 0x4292 = 14 frames - marks made and activated in these frames count for double too
