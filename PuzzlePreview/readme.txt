This directory contains a GUI tool to display and 'plan-a-gram' how to solve puzzles without needing the game and its debug mode. It is limited to the first, original IQ game as is, but could be expanded.

Usage
-----------

Pick a puzzle size from the combobox.
Enter a puzzle number between 1-200 in the puzzle box and press enter

The chosen puzzle should then display in the bottom area

At this point you can left-click on any square to gray it out displaying the current turn number. Right clicking on any square or ticking the Bomb box and left-clicking will gray out the eight surrounding cubes too, like activating a bomb in the game. Change the turn number with the box and you're all set.

Clicking the Reset Puzzle button will return the puzzle to its non-clicked state.

You may optionally enter a seed value in the seed box and click the Next Puzzle button to generate the next puzzle in the game's sequence. This will update the seed box with the new seed to ensure repeated clicks follow the same puzzle progression as the game.
